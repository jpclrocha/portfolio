					My name is Jo√£o Pedro, a.k.a JoPe, and I have recently
					graduated in Systems Development at the Federal Institute of
					Alagoas - Brazil. I have a passion for technology and am
					currently studying to be a full-stack developer, but I like
					the backend most. I also have a passion for music and
					sports. I play table tennis and I'm a very competitive
					person, so I like challenges, especially by stronger
					players, it gives me will to continuing training and
					improving.

					experience, accept the experience, appreciate the experience
